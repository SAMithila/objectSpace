# Tuned configuration for better tracking continuity

  # CHANGED: Increased from 8 to 15
  # Reason: Average gap length was 8.9 frames, so tracks were being
  # deleted before objects reappeared. 15 frames = 250ms at 60fps,
  # giving more time for temporary occlusions.
  max_age: 15
  
  # CHANGED: Reduced from 0.3 to 0.2
  # Reason: ID switches had avg IoU of 0.36, meaning valid matches
  # were being rejected. Lowering threshold allows more matches.
