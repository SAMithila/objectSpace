# Evaluation Framework Configuration
# These settings control how tracking quality is assessed

evaluation:
  # Minimum track length (frames) for a track to not be flagged as "short"
  # Short tracks often indicate false positive detections
  min_track_length: 5
  
  # IoU threshold for detecting potential ID switches
  # When a track disappears and a new track appears with IoU > this value,
  # it's flagged as a potential ID switch
  id_switch_iou_threshold: 0.3
  
  # Maximum distance (pixels) between track endpoints to consider as ID switch
  # If the new track starts within this distance of where old track ended,
  # it may be an ID switch even without IoU overlap
  id_switch_distance_threshold: 100.0
  
  # Target FPS for speed scoring
  # The speed score measures how close the pipeline is to real-time processing
  target_fps: 30.0
  
  # Output settings
  output:
    # Format for evaluation reports: console, json, markdown, or all
    format: all
    
    # Include per-track details in reports
    include_details: true
    
    # Use colored console output (auto-detected for non-TTY)
    use_colors: true

# Score thresholds for quality assessment
scoring:
  # Continuity score weights
  # - coverage_ratio: How complete tracks are (no gaps)
  # - fragmentation_rate: Percentage of tracks with gaps
  # - short_track_rate: Percentage of very short tracks
  continuity:
    coverage_weight: 0.4
    fragmentation_weight: 0.35
    short_track_weight: 0.25
  
  # Stability score thresholds
  # Based on ID switches per 100 frames
  stability:
    excellent: 0.5   # <= 0.5 switches/100 frames = 100 score
    acceptable: 2.0  # <= 2.0 switches/100 frames = 70-100 score
    poor: 5.0        # <= 5.0 switches/100 frames = 30-70 score
  
  # Speed score
  # Score is 100 when FPS >= target, scales linearly below
  speed:
    target_fps: 30.0
